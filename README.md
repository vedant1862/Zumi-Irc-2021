# Zumi-Irc-2021
Code for the 2021 International Robotics Competition using Zumi. The code essentially allows zumi to complete a 3 part obstacle course. Some notable parts of this course are driving to certain destinations on the course given a QR code, detecting stop signs and staying still, as well as line tracking.
